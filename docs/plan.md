# Plan

Building an AI-Driven Real-Time Event Simulation System

A system that simulates real-world events (e.g., city traffic, weather changes, or cybersecurity threats) using AI and real-time data streams. The system will generate unpredictable conditions that impact each microservice differently, causing dynamic scaling behaviors.


## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture

Core Microservices:

1. Event Generator Service (High Load, Bursty)
- Uses an AI model (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate dynamic events like "traffic congestion" or "server attack".
- Publishes events to Kafka.
- Scaling Trigger: Number of AI requests per second.
2. Impact Analyzer Service (CPU-Intensive, Complex Calculations)
- Evaluates how each event affects a simulated city or system.
- Runs probabilistic models (Monte Carlo simulations, for example).
- Scaling Trigger: CPU usage & queue backlog.
3. Real-Time Visualization Service (I/O Heavy, User Requests)
- Provides a dashboard for live event monitoring.
- Streams updates via WebSockets to users.
- Scaling Trigger: Active WebSocket connections.

## Event Generator Service 

- Develop a simple API that generates randomized events.
(- Optional) Use OpenAI API or a local ML model for event predictions.
- Publish events to Kafka.

## Impact Analyzer Service 

- Consume events from Kafka.
- Run simulations (Monte Carlo, Markov Chains, or AI models).
- Store analyzed data in a database.

## Real-Time Visualization Service

- React app with WebSockets for live updates.
- API to fetch historical event trends.

## üå™Ô∏è Load Testing & Scaling

- Use k6 or Gatling to simulate event surges.
- Apply custom HPA policies:
  - Event Generator: Scales based on AI processing load.
  - Impact Analyzer: Scales based on CPU load from simulations.
  - Visualization Service: Scales based on concurrent WebSocket users.

## üìä Observability & Experimentation

- Prometheus + Grafana: Dynamic scaling insights.
- Jaeger + OpenTelemetry: Trace event propagation.
- Loki: Log bursty event patterns.
- Introduce Chaos Engineering (e.g., randomly delay AI responses).
