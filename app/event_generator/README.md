# Generator

Generates data using Ai model inputs

## Notes
- AI Model Calls: In a production scenario, consider error handling, rate limiting, and asynchronous request management for the OpenAI API.
- Kafka Considerations: Ensure your Kafka broker is configured to handle bursty writes. You might need to tweak partition counts and retention settings.
- Scaling Trigger: While the HPA here uses CPU as a metric, you could integrate custom metrics (like AI request rate) via the Kubernetes Metrics API or Prometheus adapter.
- Observability: Add logging, monitoring, and tracing to track performance and issues in a high-load environment.
